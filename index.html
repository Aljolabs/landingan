                                    <p>Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. 
                                        It may, however, also include web design, web programming, and database management. Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of apps (web design). 
                                        The term development is usually reserved for the actual construction of these things (that is to say, the programming of sites).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites. 
                                        It involves designing the layout, coding the functionality, and ensuring the site works well across different devices and browsers. 
                                        The ultimate goal is to build a user-friendly, efficient online presence.
                                    </p>

                                        <h3>Most common Programming Languages, Frameworks, and Libraries in Front-End Development</h3>
                                        <li><span>HTML</span><br>Hyper Text Markup Language, or HTML for short, is a programming language for making websites and web applications. 
                                            Markup languages are computer languages to apply standard layout and formatting rules to text documents. 
                                            Dynamic and engaging content is possible using markup languages. The program has the ability to transform plain text into graphics, tables, hyperlinks, and more.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><span>CSS</span><br>CSS is an abbreviation for cascading style sheets. 
                                            This is the language used to create a website’s design and structure. 
                                            CSS is as essential as HTML for building websites. Websites would still just be sober text on a plain background if it wasn’t around.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><span>JavaScript</span><br>JavaScript is a simple, translated programming language used to enhance and add functionality to websites. 
                                            It’s versatile enough to be used for everything from adding new buttons to creating complex animations. 
                                            JavaScript extends the functionality of the browser by following basic instructions embedded within script
                                            tags in an HTML document.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><span>Angular</span><br>When it comes to web frontend frameworks, Angular is by far the most popular option. 
                                            A framework for developing highly functional and feature-rich single-page programs. 
                                            It’s a Google-made programming environment that relies on Typescript. 
                                            Angular is a series of tools for creating, building, testing, and modifying code, as well as a library of well-integrated libraries, all geared toward the creation of large online applications.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><span>React</span><br>React, or ReactJS as it is more often referred, is a popular front-end JavaScript toolkit for creating user interfaces and associated components. 
                                            It is built using MVC, but with a new data presentation and accessibility matrix. The Virtual DOM and its approach to document access and modification are two of its defining characteristics. 
                                            As a result of the DOM’s interactions with HTML and XML documents, the latter take on a tree-like structure, with each HTML element acting as an object.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><span>Backbone.js</span><br>Backbone, first published in 2010, is a simple and compact front-end framework. 
                                            It’s meant for creating single-page applications and is based on the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) syntax. 
                                            Backbone.js is a popular JavaScript library that offers frameworks with custom actions and substantial key-value binding, giving web applications the structure they need. 
                                            Libraries of enhanced APIs exist, including features like functions, declarative event handling, and views. 
                                            It has a RESTful JSON interface, so it can talk to the existing API without any problems. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li><span>Ember.js</span><br>ince 2011, developers have had access to the Ember.js frontend framework. 
                                            Aspiring web developers leverage Ember to create robust cross-platform projects, despite the fact that it is not as popular as other frameworks. 
                                            It would be another open-source option worth watching.

                                            It’s always being updated and expanded upon in order to better serve its users. So, it’s a viable alternative to the popular Bootstrap framework. 
                                            The concept of a semantic user interface has only been around for a short while. It’s widely recognized as a top frontend framework for building websites. 
                                            The success is due to the user interface’s readability, ease of use, and spontaneity. 
                                            Being written in a very straightforward programming language, it is accessible even to newcomers. 
                                            t’s a great development platform since the process for creating websites and apps is simple, and it works with a number of different third-party libraries.

                                            The usage of a single language (JavaScript) and the availability of free, open-source technology are two of the advantages. 
                                            What makes up MEAN are:
                                            <ul>MongoDB (NoSQL database) (NoSQL database).</ul>

                                            <ul>Node.js server-side JavaScript.</ul>
                                            With MEAN, you can create apps that are both quick and powerful. 
                                            The components may exchange data via the JavaScript Object Notations (JSON) language, and they have access to a vast, open-source library of modules. 
                                            This technology stack is useful for creating highly scalable software. It works well for any sort of dynamic web page or program.
